Here is what you can do with this software right now:
- Build classic geometry figures (points, lines, rays, segments and circles)
- Make intersections
- Find a middle
- Build parallel, perpendicular lines, bisectors
- View this all in an intuitive UI

## Quick guide:

### Adding an object

You can add a geometry object simply clicking on a specific button in Menu -> "New object" or the toolbar.

For fast and experienced GeoPro users there're some keyboard shorcuts added:
- P - add a Point
- L - add a Line
- R - add a Ray
- S - add a Segment
- C - add a Circle (center & some point)
- Ctrl+I - make intersection
- Ctrl+M - create a middle

There will be a label with the type of added object on the left top corner.

### Constructions

To add parallel or perpendicular line click on a point and a line first and then click needed button on the toolbar.

To add a bisector or circle by 3 points choose three points first and then click "Bisector" or "Circle by 3 points" on the toolbar.

### Managing objects

You can easily hide or delete objects in GeoPro.

To hide objects select them by clicking and then press "Hide selected objects" or Ctrl+H. You can always show all hidden object by clicking on eponymous toolbar button or Ctrl+Shift+H.

To delete objects select them by clicking and then press Delete on the keyboard (or in Menu -> "Edit"). You can delete all objects by "Clear all" button or Ctrl+Delete (You have to confirm clearing all). Notice: deleting the object with some child objects causes child objects deletion!

To change point name you can use "Change object label" on the toolbar after you've chosen a point. In the small window type a new name, press "Ok" to save and then close it.

### Changing the view

If you need to change the background, use Menu -> "Edit" -> "Background".

If you "walked too far away" from your initial position, press "Back to original view" on the toolbar.
