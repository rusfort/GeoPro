# GeoPro

GeoPro is a professional geometry toolkit for teachers & students made by Nick Rusfort (Nikolay Kozakov).

Here is what you can do with this software right now:
- Build classic geometry figures (points, lines, rays, segments, circles and angles)
- BUILD TRIANGLES
- Make intersections
- Find a middle
- Build parallel, perpendicular lines, bisectors
- View this all in an intuitive UI

## Quick guide:

### Adding an object

You can add a geometry object simply clicking on a specific button in Menu -> "New object" or the toolbar.

For fast and experienced GeoPro users there're some keyboard shorcuts added:
- P - add a Point
- L - add a Line
- R - add a Ray
- S - add a Segment
- C - add a Circle (center & some point)
- T - add a Triangle
- Ctrl+I - make an intersection
- Ctrl+M - create a middle

There will be a label with the type of added object on the left top screen corner.

### Constructions

To add parallel or perpendicular line click on a point and a line first and then click needed button on the toolbar.

To add a bisector or circle by 3 points choose three points first and then click "Bisector" or "Circle by 3 points" on the toolbar.

To add a triangle select 3 points and click "Triangle" on the toolbar or press "T" on the keyboard. You can also click first and than choose/add 3 points.

To add an angle select 3 points and click "Angle by 3 points" on the toolbar or select a ray & point and click "Angle by the ray and point" on the toolbar.

### Managing objects

You can easily hide or delete objects in GeoPro.

To hide objects select them by clicking and then press "Hide selected objects" or Ctrl+H. You can always show all hidden objects by clicking on eponymous toolbar button or Ctrl+Shift+H.

To delete objects select them by clicking and then press Delete/Backspace on the keyboard (or in Menu -> "Edit"). You can delete all objects by "Clear all" button or Ctrl+Delete (You have to confirm clearing all). Notice: deleting the object with some child objects causes child objects deletion!

To change object settings right-button-click on it or select the object and click "Open object settings" on the toolbar.

### Managing TRIANGLES

Right-button-click on a triangle and enjoy it's fantastic menu! 

You can add any base triangle points (aka bisectors intersection) and circles (aka inscribed or Euler)! 

### Managing segments & angles

If you want to show that some angles/segments are equal to aech other, you can add an arc(-s) or a stick(-s) to them using the object menu. Type a number of sticks (from 0 to 3) to make them seem equal.

### Changing the view

If you need to change the background, use Menu -> "Edit" -> "Background".

If you "walked too far away" from your initial position, press "Back to original view" on the toolbar. 

### Bugs!

In 0.0.3 (Linux & Win): circle on 3 points is added twice => when user deletes it the app crashes (already fixed, but the fix'll be in a next update).
